  abstract = {Incorporating machine learning (ML) components into software products raises new software-engineering challenges and exacerbates existing challenges. Many researchers have invested significant effort in understanding the challenges of industry practitioners working on building products with ML components, through interviews and surveys with practitioners. With the intention to aggregate and present their collective findings, we conduct a meta-summary study: We collect 50 relevant papers that together interacted with over 4758 practitioners using guidelines for systematic literature reviews. We then collected, grouped, and organized the over 500 mentions of challenges within those papers. We highlight the most commonly reported challenges and hope this meta-summary will be a useful resource for the research community to prioritize research and education in this field.},

  abstract = {Component-based development is one of the core principles behind modern software engineering practices. Understanding of causal relationships between components of a software system can yield significant benefits to developers. Yet modern software design approaches make it difficult to track and discover such relationships at system scale, which leads to growing intellectual debt. In this paper we consider an alternative approach to software design, flow-based programming (FBP), and draw the attention of the community to the connection between dataflow graphs produced by FBP and structural causal models. With expository examples we show how this connection can be leveraged to improve day-to-day tasks in software projects, including fault localisation, business analysis and experimentation.},

  abstract = {For an AI solution to evolve from a trained machine learning model into a production-ready AI system, many more things need to be considered than just the performance of the machine learning model. A production-ready AI system needs to be trustworthy, i.e. of high quality. But how to determine this in practice{\textflorin} For traditional software, ISO25000 and its predecessors have since long time been used to define and measure quality characteristics. Recently, quality models for AI systems, based on ISO25000, have been introduced. This paper applies one such quality model to a real-life case study: a deep learning platform for monitoring wildflowers. The paper presents three realistic scenarios sketching what it means to respectively use, extend and incrementally improve the deep learning platform for wildflower identification and counting. Next, it is shown how the quality model can be used as a structured dictionary to define quality requirements for data, model and software. Future work remains to extend the quality model with metrics, tools and best practices to aid AI engineering practitioners in implementing trustworthy AI systems.},

  abstract = {AI systems cannot exist without data. Now that AI models (data science and AI) have matured and are readily available to apply in practice, most organizations struggle with the data infrastructure to do so. There is a growing need for data engineers that know how to prepare data for AI systems or that can setup enterprise-wide data architectures for analytical projects. But until now, the data engineering part of AI engineering has not been getting much attention, in favor of discussing the modeling part. In this paper we aim to change this by perform a mapping study on data engineering for AI systems, i.e., AI data engineering. We found 25 relevant papers between January 2019 and June 2023, explaining AI data engineering activities. We identify which life cycle phases are covered, which technical solutions or architectures are proposed and which lessons learned are presented. We end by an overall discussion of the papers with implications for practitioners and researchers. This paper creates an overview of the body of knowledge on data engineering for AI. This overview is useful for practitioners to identify solutions and best practices as well as for researchers to identify gaps.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly advancing with a data-centered approach suitable for various domains. Nevertheless, AI faces significant challenges, particularly in data quality. Data collection from diverse sources can introduce quality issues that may threaten the development of AI-enabled systems. A growing concern in this context is the emergence of data smells - issues specific to the data used in building AI models, which can have long-term consequences. In this paper, we aim at enlarging the current body of knowledge on data smells, by proposing a two-step investigation into the matter. First, we updated an existing literature review in an effort of cataloguing the currently existing data smells and the tools to detect them. Afterward, we assess the prevalence of data smells and their correlation with data quality metrics. We identify a novel set composed of 12 data smells distributed across three additional categories. Secondly, we observe that the correlation between data smells and data quality is notably impactful, exhibiting a pronounced and substantial effect, especially in highly diffused data smell instances. This research sheds light on the complex relationship between data smells and data quality, providing valuable insights into the challenges of maintaining AI-enabled systems.},
