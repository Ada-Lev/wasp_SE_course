abstract = {In machine learning, hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is essential for effective model training and significantly impacts model performance. Hyperparameters are predefined model settings which fine-tune the model's behavior and are critical to modeling complex data patterns. Traditional HPO approaches such as Grid Search, Random Search, and Bayesian Optimization have been widely used in this field. However, as datasets grow and models increase in complexity, these approaches often require a significant amount of time and resources for HPO. This research introduces a novel approach using t-way testing---a combinatorial approach to software testing used for identifying faults with a test set that covers all t-way interactions---for HPO. T-way testing substantially narrows the search space and effectively covers parameter interactions. Our experimental results show that our approach reduces the number of necessary model evaluations and significantly cuts computational expenses while still outperforming traditional HPO approaches for the models studied in our experiments.},

abstract = { We seek a global minimum of \$U:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}\$. The solution to \$( * )({d / {dt}})X(t) = - \nabla U(X(t))\$ will find local minima. Using the idea of simulated annealing, we consider the diffusion process, \$dX(t) = - \nabla U(X(t))dt + \sigma (t)dW(t)\$, \$X(0) = x\$, where \$W( \cdot )\$ is the n-dimensional standard Brownian motion and \$\frac{1}{2}\sigma ^2 (t)\$ is the annealing rate which decreases to zero as t goes to \$\infty \$. Under suitable condition on \$U(x)\$, we prove that \$X(t)\$ converges weakly to a probability measure \$\pi \$ if for large t, \$\sigma ^2 (t) = {c / {\log t}}\$ with \$c > c\_0 \$, where \$c\_0 \$ has a simple expression involving the action function of the dynamical system \$( * )\$, \$\pi \$ concentrates on the global minima of U and is the weak limit of the Gibbs densities \$\pi \_t (x) \propto \exp ({{ - 2U(x)} / {\sigma ^2 (t)}})\$.The above result can also be formulated as follows: consider the Fokker–Planck equation (forward equation) \[\frac{\partial }{{\partial t}}V(t,y) = \frac{1}{2}\sigma ^2 (t)\Delta V(t,y) + \nabla \cdot (V(t,y)\nabla U(y))\] with \$V(0,y) = \delta \_x (y)\$.If \$\sigma ^2 (t) = {c / {\log t}}\$ for large t and \$c > c\_0 \$, then \$V(t,y) \to \pi \$ weakly. }

abstract = {Throughout the history of software engineering, the human aspects have repeatedly been recognized as important. Even though research that investigates them has been growing in the past decade, these aspects should be more generally considered. The main objective of this study is to clarify the research area concerned with human aspects of software engineering and to create a common platform for future research. In order to meet the objective, we propose a definition of the research area behavioral software engineering (BSE) and present results from a systematic literature review based on the definition. The result indicates that there are knowledge gaps in the research area of behavioral software engineering and that earlier research has been focused on a few concepts, which have been applied to a limited number of software engineering areas. The individual studies have typically had a narrow perspective focusing on few concepts from a single unit of analysis. Further, the research has rarely been conducted in collaboration by researchers from both software engineering and social science. Altogether, this review can help put a broader set of human aspects higher on the agenda for future software engineering research and practice.}
