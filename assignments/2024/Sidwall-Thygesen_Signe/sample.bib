abstract = {AI systems cannot exist without data. Now that AI models (data science and AI) have matured and are readily available to apply in practice, most organizations struggle with the data infrastructure to do so. There is a growing need for data engineers that know how to prepare data for AI systems or that can setup enterprise-wide data architectures for analytical projects. But until now, the data engineering part of AI engineering has not been getting much attention, in favor of discussing the modeling part. In this paper we aim to change this by perform a mapping study on data engineering for AI systems, i.e., AI data engineering. We found 25 relevant papers between January 2019 and June 2023, explaining AI data engineering activities. We identify which life cycle phases are covered, which technical solutions or architectures are proposed and which lessons learned are presented. We end by an overall discussion of the papers with implications for practitioners and researchers. This paper creates an overview of the body of knowledge on data engineering for AI. This overview is useful for practitioners to identify solutions and best practices as well as for researchers to identify gaps.},

abstract = {In the rapidly advancing field of artificial intelligence, software development has emerged as a key area of innovation. Despite the plethora of general-purpose AI assistants available, their effectiveness diminishes in complex, domain-specific scenarios. Noting this limitation, both the academic community and industry players are relying on contextualized coding AI assistants. These assistants surpass general-purpose AI tools by integrating proprietary, domain-specific knowledge, offering precise and relevant solutions. Our study focuses on the initial experiences of 62 participants who used a contextualized coding AI assistant --- named StackSpot AI--- in a controlled setting. According to the participants, the assistants' use resulted in significant time savings, easier access to documentation, and the generation of accurate codes for internal APIs. However, challenges associated with the knowledge sources necessary to make the coding assistant access more contextual information as well as variable responses and limitations in handling complex codes were observed. The study's findings, detailing both the benefits and challenges of contextualized AI assistants, underscore their potential to revolutionize software development practices, while also highlighting areas for further refinement.},

	abstract = {Sustainability science and sustainability transition studies are interdisciplinary fields. Interdisciplinarity is understood to support out-of-the-box thinking and thus facilitate scientific advancements. Interdisciplinary research projects dealing with complex issues might need project management approaches that support learning, adaptation, and innovation. Agile is a management approach that has been developed to facilitate collaboration, learning, creativity, innovation, and reflectivity. Due to these qualities, Agile might be a suitable approach to managing interdisciplinary research projects. Agile project management is still new in academic research settings. Only limited information about how to apply it in an academic setting exists. To fill this gap the Agile principles are translated to fit the academic context. The article then outlines how Agile principles can be applied to an academic research program, that did not consciously plan to apply this approach. The translation of the principles will permit other researchers to intentionally use them in their interdisciplinary research projects. Furthermore, other researchers can build on the insights provided in this article to overcome the challenges that Agile can bring.},

  title={{Management of a multidisciplinary research project: A case study on adopting agile methods.}},
  author={Senabre Hidalgo, Enric},
  journal={Journal of Research Practice},
  abstract = {Agile methods, initially used by cross-functional teams in software development projects, can also facilitate teamwork in collaborative research projects. For this, project management-related issues need to be addressed, including the challenge of finding practical means for coordinating scientific collaboration, while garnering commitment from all participants. This article explores the utilisation of agile methods by a semi-distributed scientific team, for coordinating a multidisciplinary research project. It examines how these methods can contribute to task coordination in scientific research and highlights key factors for successful adoption of the agile framework in collaborative research projects. Data are collected from a research team, after a 10-week phase of implementing agile methods. Data analysis focuses on the effectiveness of the digital tools used for communication and coordination during the project. The findings indicate a perception that agile methods contribute to coordination and improved teamwork during project development, with less agreement on the utility of some of the tools used. Also, it suggests the importance of involvement of the principal investigator and the role of a facilitator.},
